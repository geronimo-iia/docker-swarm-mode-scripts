On its HTTP port, a Dgraph Alpha exposes a number of admin endpoints.

https://docs.dgraph.io/deploy#more-about-dgraph

/health returns HTTP status code 200 and an “OK” message if the worker is running, HTTP 503 otherwise.
/admin/shutdown initiates a proper shutdown of the Alpha.
/admin/export initiates a data export.
By default the Alpha listens on localhost for admin actions (the loopback address only accessible from the same machine). The --bindall=true option binds to 0.0.0.0 and thus allows external connections.
